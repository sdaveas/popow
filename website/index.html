        <h6 class="docs-header">What are NIPoPoWs?</h6>

        <p>
          Non-Interactive Proofs of Proof-of-Work (NIPoPoWs) are short stand-alone strings that a computer program can inspect to verify that an event happened on a proof-of-work-based blockchain without connecting to the blockchain network and without downloading all block headers. For example, these proofs can illustrate that a cryptocurrency payment was made.

        <h6 class="docs-header">What are NIPoPoWs useful for?</h6>

        <p>
          NIPoPoWs allow very efficient mobile wallets to be created. <a href='https://bitcoin.org/en/developer-guide#simplified-payment-verification-spv'>SPV wallets</a> are already very lightweight compared to full nodes because they only require the download of block headers, not the whole blockchain. NIPoPoW wallets need to download only a small <strong>sample</strong> of block headers, around 250, when SPV clients need to download half a million block headers. The sample needed changes but doesn't grow much in size as the blockchain grows larger by the years, even after decades of data has been accumulated.
        </p>

        <h6 class="docs-header">Sidechains</h6>

        <p>
          NIPoPoWs allow blockchains to communicate and interoperate, like APIs. Because the miners that run a blockchain do not monitor other blockchain networks, this is difficult to do without short proofs. If a blockchain supports smart contracts, like Ethereum, a contract can be written to validate a NIPoPoW to check that something happened on another blockchain and react to it. For instance, a payment made on <a href='https://ethereumclassic.org/'>Ethereum Classic</a> could cause a payment to be released by an <a href='https://www.ethereum.org/'>Ethereum</a> smart contract.
        </p>

        <h6 class="docs-header">NIPoPoW support</h6>

        <p>
          Proofs about a blockchain can be produced only if the blockchain supports NIPoPoWs in its blocks. This support can be added retroactively without the need for a soft or hard fork and without requiring miner approval through the use of <strong>velvet forks</strong>.
        </p>

        <p>
          Some cryptocurrencies already include build-in NIPoPoWs support. <a href='https://ergoplatform.org/'>ERGO</a>, <a href="https://nimiq.com/">Nimiq</a>, and <a href="https://webdollar.io/">WebDollar</a> have added support since their genesis.

      <h6 class="docs-header">How do they work?</h6>

      <p>
        Proofs of Proof-of-Work are based on the simple observation that some blocks achieve a better <a href='https://bitcoin.org/en/developer-guide#proof-of-work'>mining target</a> than others. For example, the current difficulty may require that a block hash needs to start with 10 zeroes, but it so happens that some block hashes start with 15. These <strong>superblocks</strong> are rare and happen randomly. The idea with NIPoPoWs is that the whole list of block headers doesn't need to be presented to the network, as these blocks capture cumulative difficulty on average. If a blockchain portion has 128 blocks, then on average half of them (64) will have an extra zero in the binary representation of their hashes, a quarter (32) will have two zeroes, and so on. A blockchain can therefore be "compressed" by only sending these blocks on the network.
      </p>

      <p>
        The average distribution of blocks is illustrated in the following figure. The bottom part shows the regular blockchain. Higher levels show blocks with 1, 2, or 3 extra zeroes in their hashes. Taking only these blocks, one can form a <strong>superchain</strong>.
      </p>

      <img src='images/hierarchical-ledger.png' alt='The hierarchical blockchain' width='500' class='figure'/>

      <p>
        If these superblocks are presented in the form of a proof, each needs to include a pointer to its previous block. This is similar to how regular blocks include a <a href='https://bitcoin.org/en/developer-reference#term-previous-block-header-hash'>pointer to the previous block</a>. This connectivity is called <strong>interlinking</strong> and is the reason why a velvet fork is required.
      </p>

      <p>
        The full details of how to interlink the blockchain, as well as how to produce, verify, and compare proofs are given in our papers.
