\section{Introduction}


%% must verify the entire chain of proofs-of-work, which grows
%% linearly over time. On the contrary, clients based on NIPoPoWs require resources
%% only logarithmic in the length of the blockchain.

%
Today, Bitcoin and Ethereum remain the two largest proof-of-work
cryptocurrencies by market cap. However, the ecosystem has grown diverse, with
dozens of viable ``altcoin'' competitors.
%
Given such an environment,  it becomes increasingly  important to be able to
efficiently handle  multiple blockchains by the same client and reliably
transfer assets between them.
%
%
%
%We envision our NIPoPoW protocol will form the basis of an
%efficient multi-blockchain client, which could efficiently support payments
%using hundreds of different cryptocurrencies.
%Our protocol improves the performance of client.
%blockchain protocols in general
%are increasingly used as components of larger systems.

The first objective requires optimizing the ``SPV client'' described in the
original Bitcoin paper~\cite{bitcoin} which requires processing an amount of
data growing linearly with the size of the blockchain (namely, the block
headers).

%% Cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin~\cite{bitcoin}\cite{bitcoinsoftware} and
%% Ethereum~\cite{ethereum} are peer-to-peer networks that maintain a globally
%% consistent transaction ledger, using a consensus protocol based on proof-of-work
%% (PoW) puzzles~\cite{pow,hashcash}. Worker nodes called ``miners'' expend
%% computational work in order to reach agreement on the state of the network.
%% Clients on the network, such as mobile phone apps, must verify these
%% PoWs in order to determine the correct view of the network's state, something necessary
%% to transmit and receive payments correctly.

%% In this work we introduce, analyze and instantiate a new primitive,
%% Non-Interactive Proofs of Proof-of-Work (NIPoPoWs), which can be adapted into
%% existing cryptocurrencies to support more efficient clients. A traditional

The second objective has received  significant attention in the context of
``cross-chain'' applications, i.e., logical transactions that span multiple
separate blockchains. Simple cross-chain transactions are feasible today: the
most well-known is the atomic exchange~\cite{tiernolan,herlihy2018atomic}, e.g.,
a trade of bitcoin for ether. However, more sophisticated
applications~
\cite{interledger,DBLP:journals/corr/DilleyPWPGF16,
      lerner,drivechains,wood2016polkadot,buchman2016tendermint}
could be enabled by a more efficient proof process, which would allow the
blockchain of one cryptocurrency to embed a client of a separate cryptocurrency.
This concept, initially popularized by a proposal by Back et al.
~\cite{sidechains} can be used to avoid a difficult upgrade process: a new
blockchain with additional features, such as experimental opcodes, can be backed
by deposits in the original bitcoin currency, obviating the need to transfer
capital to the new cryptocurrency. As one example of cross-chain interfacing, we
describe an initial coin offering (ICO)~\cite{ico} which distributes tokens
issued on one blockchain, but allows paying for them using coins in another
blockchain.

% These examples illustrate that our solution is a key component for two important
% pillars needed for next-generation blockchains: \emph{interoperability} and
% \emph{scalability}. While we use bitcoin concretely as an example, any
% proof-of-work cryptocurrency can adopt our techniques.

\subsection{Our contributions}
Our main technical contribution is the introduction and instantiation of a new
cryptographic primitive called \textit{Non-Interactive} Proofs of Proof-of-Work
(NIPoPoW).

We present a formal model and a provably secure instantiation of NIPoPoWs. We
introduce the first formal security definitions of (NI)PoPoW protocols and their
security. Our contribution builds on previous work of the backbone model
\cite{backbone} in terms of modeling and~\cite{KLS} who introduced the concept
of (interactive) Proofs of Proof-of-Work, which, in turn, are based on previous
discussion of such concepts in the bitcoin forums~\cite{highway}. In fact, we
present an \emph{attack} against the construction of~\cite{KLS} that can be
mounted by an adversary with less than $50\%$ of hashing power. As a result, our
construction is the \emph{first secure} Proof of Proof-of-Work (regardless of
interactivity), assuming honest majority. Furthermore, our solution is
non-interactive making it the first protocol of this kind.

Regarding the predicates that are to be demonstrated, previous work allowed
only proving that the $k$-sized \emph{suffix} of the currently adopted
blockchain is as claimed. We generalize this notion to prove any
\emph{predicate} across a class of predicates which we call \emph{infix
sensitive}. This enables proving powerful statements pertaining to the
blockchain such as the fact that a transaction took place, that a smart contract
method ran with certain parameters, or that a payment was made into an account.
The most basic application of such proofs, payment verification, require more
general predicates than what is covered in previous work, and we enable these.

We prove the proofs are optimistically succinct meaning that they are
logarithmic in size in honest conditions. Improving previous work, we show that,
in the optimistic model of no adversarial mining power, succinctness can be
achieved for even \textit{adversarially-generated} proofs by introducing the
novel concept of \textit{certificates of badness}. Our definition fills the gap
in terms of security modeling and design that existed in previous proposals,
e.g., the notion of cumulative ``Dynamic Member Multisignature''
~\cite{sidechains}.

We provide concrete parameterization and empirical analysis showing the savings
of our approach versus existing clients. Using real data from the Bitcoin and
other networks, we quantify the savings of NIPoPoWs over the previous techniques
of constructing SPV verifiers. For a multi-blockchain client that receives 100
payments per day, we offer a 90\% reduction in bandwidth compared to na\"ive
SPV.

% In the Appendix, we propose a novel gradual deployment path for our scheme which
% we term a \emph{velvet fork} and which can provide the benefits of our scheme
% without requiring miner adoption unlike typical \emph{hard} or \emph{soft
% forks}. This technique may be of independent interest for other protocols.

In summary, we make the following contributions:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item We construct the first \emph{provably secure} Proofs of Proof-of-Work
        and give a formal definition of security. We make them
        \emph{non-interactive}.
  \item We describe an \emph{attack} against the only previously known Proof of
        Proof-of-Work construction~\cite{KLS}.
  \item We extend proofs to allow proving \emph{any predicate} out of
        \emph{generic class} pertaining to data deep within a blockchain.
  \item We improve \emph{succinctness} of previous proofs by weakening the
        optimality assumptions.
  \item We provide \emph{experimental data} which measure the efficiency and
        security of our scheme as well as concrete parameters based on these
        experiments.
\end{enumerate}
