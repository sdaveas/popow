Open consensus protocols based on proof-of-work (PoW) mining are at the core of cryptocurrencies such Bitcoin and Ethereum. In this work, we construct a new primitive called Non-Interactive Proofs of Proof-of-Work (NIPoPoWs) that can be adapted into existing PoW-based cryptocurrencies to improve their performance and extend their functionality. Unlike a traditional blockchain client which must verify the entire linearly-growing chain of PoWs, clients based on NIPoPoWs require resources only logarithmic in the length of the blockchain. NIPoPoWs are thus \emph{succinct} proofs and require only a single message between the prover and the verifier of the transaction.

With our construction we are able to prove a broad array of useful blockchain predicates, including predicates about facts buried deep within a blockchain which is necessary for the basic application of accepting payments. Our scheme is provably secure.

The main application of our scheme is to build \emph{superlight} clients which perform much better than traditional light bitcoin clients based on SPV such as today's mobile wallets. We provide empirical validation for NIPoPoWs through an implementation and benchmark study, in the context of an application: A multi-blockchain client that supports all proof-of-work currencies rather than just one, with up to 90\% reduction in bandwidth. Using our experimental data, we provide concrete parameters for our scheme. Finally, we describe how our primitive can be deployed to existing blockchains such as Bitcoin without a hard or soft fork.
