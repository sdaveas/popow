Open consensus protocols based on proof-of-work (PoW) mining are at the core of
cryptocurrencies such Bitcoin and Ethereum, and many others. In this
work, we construct a new primitive called
Non-Interactive-Proofs-of-Proof-of-Work (NIPoPoWs) that can be adapted into
existing PoW-based cryptocurrencies to improve their performance and extend
their functionality. Unlike a traditional blockchain client which must verify
the entire linearly-growing chain of PoWs, clients based on NIPoPoWs require
resources only logarithmic in the length of the blockchain. NIPoPoWs are thus
\emph{succinct} proofs and require only a single message between the prover and
the verifier of the transaction.

With our construction we are able to prove a broad array of useful blockchain
predicates in the context of cross PoW-based blockchain transfers of assets,
including predicates about facts buried deep within a blockchain which is
necessary for the basic application of accepting payments. Our scheme is
provably secure.

We provide empirical validation for NIPoPoWs through an implementation and
benchmark study, in the context of two new applications: First, we consider a
multi-client blockchain that supports all proof-of-work currencies rather than
just one, with up to 90\% reduction in bandwidth.  Second, we discuss a
``cross-chain ICO'' application that spans multiple independent blockchains.
Using our experimental data, we provide concrete parameters for our scheme.
