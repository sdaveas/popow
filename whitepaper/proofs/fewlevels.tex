\begin{proof}
    % \dznote{What is $S$? You need to condition it on the random oracle
    % giving the right output.}

    Each block id in $S$ is generated by the random oracle, so $\Pr[\text{id}
    \leq T 2^{-\mu}] = 2^{-\mu}$. These are independent Bernoulli trials. For
    each $B \in S$, let $X^{\mu}_B \in \{0, 1\}$ be the random variable
    indicating whether the block belongs to level $\mu$ and let $D_\mu = \sum_{B
    \in S} X^\mu_B$ indicate their sum, which is a Binomial distribution with
    parameters $(|S|, 2^{-\mu})$ and expectation $E[D_{\mu}] = |S| 2^{-\mu}$.

    All of the $X^{\mu}$ are independent. We apply a Binomial Chernoff
    bound to the sum. We have
    $\Pr[D_\mu \geq (1 + \delta)E[D_\mu]] \leq
    \exp(-\frac{\delta^2}{3}E[D_\mu])$. Letting $\mu = \log(|S|)$ we have that
    $E[D_\mu] = 1$. Therefore $\Pr[D_\mu \geq 1 + \delta] \leq
    \exp(-\frac{\delta^2}{3})$. Requiring $1 + \delta = m$, we get $\Pr[D_\mu
    \geq m] \leq \exp(-\frac{(m - 1)^2}{3})$, which is negligible in $m$.
