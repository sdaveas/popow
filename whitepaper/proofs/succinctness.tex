\begin{proof}
    Assume $\chain$ is an honest party's chain. From
    Theorem~\ref{thm.few-levels}, the number of levels in the NIPoPoW is at most
    $\log(|\chain|)$ with overwhelming probability in $m$. First, observe that
    the count of blocks in the highest level will be less than $4m$ from
    Theorem~\ref{thm.large-expansion}; otherwise a higher superblock level would
    exist. From Corollary~\ref{lem.superchain-distribution}, we know that at all
    levels $\mu$ the chain will be good. Therefore, for each $\mu$ superchain
    $\chain$ the supporting $(\mu - 1)$-superchain will only need to span the
    $m$-long suffix of the $\mu$-superchain above. For the $m$-long suffix of
    each superchain of level $\mu$, the supporting superchain of level $\mu - 1$
    will have at most $4m$ blocks from Lemma~\ref{lem.small-support}. Therefore
    the size of the proof is $4m \log(|\chain|)$.
