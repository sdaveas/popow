\begin{proof}
As long as the number of blocks on which the predicate depends is
polylogarithmic ($< d$) with respect to the chain length, our proofs remain
succinct. Specifically, the proof size for the suffix has exactly the same size.
Then the part of the proof that is of interest is the output of the
\textsf{followDown} algorithm. However, notice that this algorithm will on
average produce as many blocks as the difference of levels between $B'$ and $E$,
which is at most logarithmic in the chain size. Hence the proof sizes will be in
expectation $(m + |\chain'|)\log(|\chain|)$, which remains succinct if
$|\chain'| \in O(polylog(|\chain|))$.
\Qed
\end{proof}
