    \textbf{Block counts and regularity. }
    For the blocks count and regularity, we refer the reader to \cite{backbone}
    for the full proof.

    \textbf{Round count. }
    First, observe that $Z_{ijk}^\mu \sim \textsf{Bern}(2^{-\mu}p)$ and these
    are jointly independent. Therefore $Z_S^\mu \sim \textsf{Bin}(tq|S|,
    2^{-\mu}p)$ and $|S| \sim \textsf{NB}(Z_S,\allowbreak 2^{-\mu}p)$. So $\mathbb{E}(|S|) =
    2^\mu\frac{Z_S}{pqt}$. Applying a tail bound to the negative binomial
    distribution, we obtain that $\Pr[|S| < (1 - \epsilon)\mathbb{E}(|S|)] \in
    \Omega(\epsilon^2 m)$. \Qed
