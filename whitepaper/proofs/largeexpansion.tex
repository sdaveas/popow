\begin{proof}
    Because each block of level $\mu - 1$ was generated as a query to the random
    oracle, it constitutes an independent Bernoulli trial and the number of
    blocks in level $\mu$, namely $\pi\upchain^\mu$, is a Binomial distribution
    with parameters $(4m, 1/2)$. Observing that $E[\chain'\upchain^\mu] = 2m$ and
    applying a Chernoff bound, we get
    $\Pr[|\chain'\upchain^\mu| \leq m]
    = \Pr[|\chain'\upchain^\mu| \leq (1 - \frac{1}{2})2m]
    \leq \exp(-\frac{(1/2)^2}{2} 2m)$ which is negligible in
    $m$.

    % \dznote{Invoke typicality and get rid of all probabilities here. You
    % will need to define ``honest typicality'' and multiquality both ways.}
